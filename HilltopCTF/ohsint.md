### **Description:** Here you have an image file. Try to look for anything in it and piece the flag together. [image.jpg](https://capturetheflag.online/files/33def45adb6900c6c2df53a1654700ef/image.jpg)

Running exiftool on the image reveals that there is a comment containing a [link](http://shellserver1.hilltopctf.masterwayz.nl:8526). With a quick look around
the website, we find three parts of a flag. One in the page source, one in the location maps section, and one on their blog page. 

## **Flag:** HilltopCTF{W4TCH-0UT-F0R-L34K5_cc446f6ceb756be90ee80304236e8b21}
